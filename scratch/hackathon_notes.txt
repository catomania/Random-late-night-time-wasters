Finally joined in on a company Hackathon on 10/29. Still need to fix the code and met w/ someone to help on 10/30. It's a lot tougher dealing with a larger codebase and a huge team working on a single codebase.

Update: need to trace the program since the script isn't working as planned. Also planning to re-group with other teammates (non-technical) to see if this project is worth pursuing.
