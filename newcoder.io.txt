These are notes I'm taking as I work through the new coder tutorial.

Found this website here: http://newcoder.io/about/

Am starting to work through the beginner's tutorial (which, while 'beginner' is still a step more advanced compared to Learn Python The Hard Way or Automate The Boring Stuff. There is a larger emphasis on git commands.

Just figured out how to push add an existing project to Github: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

Ah, may need to scrap and replace the whole thing because I uploaded a 'child' directory when I should have uploaded the 'new coder' file instead. 

-Basic Git command references: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository

-General rules of ordering imports: Standard Library modules, External/third party packages/modules, Internal/self-written modules (most mainstream to least mainstream?)

-Reminder to self: after I make my virtualenv, I need to manually re-install the requirements.txt stuff http://newcoder.io/dataviz/part-0/

-Changing remote URLs https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/
