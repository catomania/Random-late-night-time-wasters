These are notes I'm taking as I work through the new coder tutorial.

Found this website here: http://newcoder.io/about/

Am starting to work through the beginner's tutorial (which, while 'beginner' is still a step more advanced compared to Learn Python The Hard Way or Automate The Boring Stuff. There is a larger emphasis on git commands.

Just figured out how to push add an existing project to Github: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

Ah, may need to scrap and replace the whole thing because I uploaded a 'child' directory when I should have uploaded the 'new coder' file instead.
